## "Kaizen", Get better at getting better.

Many people are satisfied with just dwelling on the surface. However, I believe in something different.

I believe that to go beyond, just need to know the right questions, and
I choose to work with technology because the possibilities are endless when you know what to look for.

Focus and discipline are my guides, and my real passion is learning to learn and being my best version every day!
